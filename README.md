A repo for practising code golf in.

## This Challenge

A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of a given alphabet.

Write a program that will receive various sentences as arguments and print those that are valid pangrams, meaning they use all letters from a-z, case insensitive.

## The Structure

- The `main` branch remains empty on purpose.
- Each branch from `main` is a separate coding challenge.
- Each commit is one step closer (hopefully) to good coding muscle memory
